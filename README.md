# Basic image processing program

A simple image processing program made with *C* containg a large amount of algorithms to test.
Currently supports the following file formats:

- RAW (Planar only)


### Algorithms

- Shift bits
- Threshold
- Auto threshold
- Negative
- Square root
- Contrast enhancement
- Brightness
- Contrast
- Histogram
- Rotate
- Image summarization
- Image subtraction
- Image convolution (Sobel, Gaussian Blur, Sharpen)
- Image equalization [RGB]
- Image equalization [HSV]
- Image equalization [YUV]


### TODO

- [ ] Color to Grayscale algorithm
- [ ] Better encoder
- [ ] Undo/Redo system
- [ ] Check sum of kernel windows
- [ ] Documentation of the source code
- [ ] Check malloc() if read another file
